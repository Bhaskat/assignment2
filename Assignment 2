Explain why selenium is important in web 
scraping.
• Selenium is an automation testing 
framework for web applications/websites 
which can also control the browser to 
navigate the website just like a human. 
Selenium uses a web-driver package that 
can take control of the browser and mimic 
user-oriented actions to trigger desired 
events
2.) What's the difference between scraping images 
and scraping websites?Use an example to 
demonstrate your point.
• Image scraping is a subset of the web 
scraping technology. While web scraping 
deals with all forms of web data extraction, 
image scraping only focuses on the media 
side – images, videos, audio, and so on.
• Web scraping is the process of using bots to 
extract content and data from a website. 
Unlike screen scraping, which only copies 
pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping 
extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, 
data stored in a database. then replicate entire website content 
elsewhere
• There is minor difference that Image 
scraping works on media content where as 
web scarping works on all the data 
3.) Explain how MongoDB indexes data.
• MongoDB uses multikey indexes to index 
the content stored in arrays. If you index a 
field that holds an array value, MongoDB 
creates separate index entries for every 
element of the array. These multikey 
indexes allow queries to select documents 
that contain arrays by matching on element 
or elements of the arrays.
4.) What is the significance of the SET modifier?
• Set expressions are used to define the scope 
of a calculation. The central part of the set 
expression is the set modifier that specifies 
a selection.S
